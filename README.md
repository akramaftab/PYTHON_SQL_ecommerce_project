# Ecommerce Analytics Project (Python & SQL)

## Short Description / Purpose

This project dives into the data behind an ecommerce platformâ€”uncovering how customers shop, what products sell the most, and when sales peak. Using Python and SQL together, the goal is to turn raw order and product records into a story that makes sense for both business leaders and data enthusiasts. In short: showing where growth, loyalty, and profitability truly come from.

## Project Objective

The project focuses on answering practical questions for ecommerce growth: Which product categories matter the most? How do customers prefer to pay? When do sales peak across the year? And which cities or buyers are driving the biggest impact? By turning numbers into patterns and percentages, it gives businesses a clear path to optimize marketing, inventory, and customer strategy.

## Dataset Used

The analysis works with a multi-year ecommerce dataset (2016â€“2018) containing:

* Orders, order items, payments, products, and customer tables
* Timestamps for order placement and delivery
* Product categories and seller information
* Payment values and installment details
* Customer locations across multiple Brazilian cities and states

## Key Questions (KPIs)

* How many orders were placed each year, and how fast is revenue growing?
* Which product categories and sellers are leading in sales?
* Do installment payments dominate, and what does that mean for customer behavior?
* How do different cities and states contribute to total sales?
* When do orders peak during the year?
* What role does retention and repeat purchase play in growth?

## Process

* Load and clean data using **Python (Pandas, Numpy)**
* Run exploratory analysis and KPI calculations in **SQL**
* Use **Matplotlib and Seaborn** to visualize sales, category performance, customer spread, and payment patterns
* Transform results into clear percentage-driven summaries

### Visualization & Interaction

All results and charts are built in **Jupyter Notebook**, making it interactive and easy to follow the business story from raw data to final insights.

## What We Found (Summary KPIs)

## Key Takeaways & What This Means

* **Sales skyrocketed** by over **12,000% from 2016 to 2017**â€”a sign of explosive early growth.
* The **top five categories drive nearly half of sales**, making them the foundation for profitability.
* **Installment-based payments dominate**, showing customer comfort with spreading costs over time.
* **Sales spikes align with seasonal buying trends** (Q2 and Q4), opening opportunities for targeted promotions.
* **Repeat customers and retention** add measurable long-term valueâ€”critical for sustaining growth.

## What Should We Do Next?

* Double down on **best-selling categories** with focused promotions and stronger inventory planning.
* Create **city-based campaigns**, starting with SÃ£o Paulo and other high-value hubs.
* Refine **installment payment options**, since customers clearly prefer this method.
* Plan **seasonal campaigns** around Mayâ€“June and December to capture peak demand.
* Invest in **customer loyalty programs** to drive repeat sales and retention.

## Final Thoughts

This project transforms ecommerce data into a narrative that highlights growth drivers and customer behavior. Instead of just tracking numbers, it shows what matters most for scaling revenue, building loyalty, and planning ahead with confidence.

## Tech Tools Used

* Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn for analysis & visualization)
* SQL (for KPI extraction and aggregation)
* Jupyter Notebook (for interactive storytelling)
